Introduction to Midjourney
What is Midjourney?

Imagine having a personal artist at your fingertips, transforming your thoughts and ideas into stunning visuals within minutes. That's the magic of Midjourney, a cutting-edge AI program and service, brought to life by the creative minds at the San Francisco-based independent research lab, Midjourney, Inc. As a brilliant brainchild of artificial intelligence, Midjourney takes natural language descriptions called "prompts," and transforms them into captivating images, much like OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.

 

Unlocking the power of Midjourney is as simple as joining their official Discord server, sending a direct message to the bot, or inviting the bot to a third-party server. By typing a prompt with the /imagine command, you'll unleash the AI's creative prowess, resulting in a mesmerizing set of four images. From here, you can choose your favorite masterpiece and watch it come to life in even greater detail through upscaling. With Midjourney, the artistic possibilities are virtually limitless!

How to get into Midjourney? 
Ready to embark on a creative journey with Midjourney? First, hop on board the official Midjourney Discord server or invite the bot to a third-party server. With a verified Discord account, you can sail smoothly through the onboarding process on Midjourney.com or their Discord server. Congratulations, you've unlocked the gateway to endless creativity üîì

How to start generating images with Midjourney?

To conjure up mesmerizing images, simply type the /imagine command in a designated channel or direct message. Describe the visual masterpiece you wish to create in the prompt field and hit return. Watch in awe as Midjourney weaves its magic and generates a set of four images inspired by your vision.

How to start to refine created image? 
Once you have your initial set of images, it's time to polish your artwork. Choose to upscale your image, adding more details; create variations, exploring different takes on your theme; or rerun the job with the same prompt to discover new possibilities. Use the U and V buttons to upscale and create variations, respectively, and the üîÑ button to rerun the job. Let your creativity soar as you refine your AI-generated art to perfection!

The ultimate guide for pro prompts building for Midjourney
1. Begin with a basic outline
Imagine yourself as an artist, preparing to draw a picture. Start by making a simple, clear description of the image you want to create. Describe the main subject, the scene, or the small details you want to include. This basic outline will help your AI assistant understand the main idea of your vision.

 

Example:

 

A tranquil forest with a winding river and a small wooden bridge
A child flying a colorful kite on a sunny beach
A busy city street at night with bright neon signs and people walking by
 

As you refine your prompt, remember that a picture is worth a thousand words. The more detailed and vivid your description, the more remarkable the results will be. Now unleash your inner artist and let Midjourney bring your masterpiece to life üñºÔ∏è‚ú®

2. Enhance with style and keywords
With the basic outline ready, it's time to add some style and keywords to make your image more interesting. Midjourney's AI is like a talented artist, able to create images in different styles like abstract, dream-like, or true-to-life. By choosing a style or adding relevant keywords, you can guide the AI to make an image that matches your vision. Play around with different styles and keywords, like mixing colors, to find the perfect combination for your desired result.

 

Examples: 

 

A city skyline at dusk in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night::3, with vibrant colors::2 and swirling clouds::1.
A dreamy underwater scene::2 featuring a mermaid::1 playing a harp::1, surrounded by glowing jellyfish::2, in a surrealist style reminiscent of Salvador Dali.
A detailed medieval battle scene::3, with knights clad in shining armor::2 and dragons soaring overhead::1, inspired by the epic style of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.
An abstract representation of a tranquil forest::3, with geometric shapes::2 forming trees and foliage, and a color palette inspired by Wassily Kandinsky's paintings::1.
 

Experiment with various styles and keywords to uncover the ideal combination that brings your artistic vision to life with Midjourney.

3. Master the art of aspect ratios
Imagine Midjourney as a skilled painter, ready to create images in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit your vision. Just as an artist stretches canvas over a frame, you can customize the aspect ratio of your generated image. Simply add a double dash followed by the perfect ratio code (e.g., ‚Äìar 16:9 for a scenic landscape) to the end of your prompt. It's like tailoring a suit; you'll ensure your masterpiece fits the dimensions you have in mind flawlessly.

 

Examples: 

 

A serene and peaceful scene of a girl reading a book under a blossoming cherry tree during springtime ‚Äìar 2:3
A breathtaking, Van Gogh-inspired starry night sky over a quaint, sleepy village nestled among rolling hills ‚Äìar 16:9
A vibrant, cubist-style portrait of a jazz musician playing a saxophone in the midst of an energetic performance ‚Äìar 1:1
A towering cyberpunk cityscape filled with neon lights, bustling streets, and futuristic skyscrapers, reminiscent of Blade Runner ‚Äìar 9:16
 

By simply adding a double dash followed by the perfect ratio code (e.g., ‚Äìar 16:9 for a scenic landscape) to the end of your prompt, you'll tailor your AI-generated artwork to the dimensions you desire.

4. Unleash your creativity with advanced settings

Picture Midjourney is a versatile tool kit, filled with advanced settings like seed, stylization, and chaos parameters that empower you to fine-tune your generated images. It's like having a magic wand that can conjure up the perfect blend of randomness, artistic flair, and image variation. Don't be afraid to mix and match these settings, experimenting with different values like a mad scientist, until you strike the perfect balance for your creative vision. Embrace the power and let your imagination run wild!

‚ö° BOWWE Growth Hack: 

Unleash the power of Midjourney's customization by tweaking these captivating parameters to refine your image-generation process:

 

Seed: Take the reins of serendipity with the "‚Äìseed [NUMBER]" parameter, orchestrating the perfect harmony of your generated images for consistent masterpieces.

 

Stylization: Dial up or down the "‚Äìs" parameter to effortlessly glide between artistic styles, with a spectrum of values from 0 (subtle) to 1000 (dramatic).

 

Chaos: Embrace the element of surprise with the chaos parameter, crafting a mesmerizing mosaic of initial image grids using values between 0 (tame) and 100 (wild).

Dive into the world of Midjourney and orchestrate a symphony of stunning visuals by fine-tuning these parameters to your heart's content!

 

Examples: 

 

A tranquil Zen garden with a cherry blossom tree ‚Äìseed 42 ‚Äìs 200 ‚Äìc 50
Vincent Van Gogh painting a futuristic cityscape ‚Äìseed 24 ‚Äìs 800 ‚Äìc 10
Salvador Dali's take on a neon-lit cyberpunk alley ‚Äìseed 99 ‚Äìs 500 ‚Äìc 70
A steampunk dragon soaring above a Victorian city ‚Äìseed 7 ‚Äìs 300 ‚Äìc 30
 

Remember, these settings are merely guidelines. Feel free to tweak them to your liking and explore the limitless potential of Midjourney's advanced settings!

5. Spotlight your masterpiece with weights
Picture your image as a symphony, with every element playing its part to create a visual harmony. Sometimes, you'll want the soloist to take center stage. Enter the "::" notation - your conductor's baton - to assign weight ratios to different parts of your prompt, orchestrating the AI to magnify or dim specific elements, ensuring your visual magnum opus shines brilliantly.

 

Examples: 

 

[Eiffel Tower]::3 illuminated at night with [fireworks]::1
[A roaring lion]::2 in front of a [sunset]::1 on the African savannah
[Starry Night]::4 sky by Vincent Van Gogh combined with [The Persistence of Memory]::1 by Salvador Dal√≠
 

By using the "::" notation to adjust the weight of various elements in your prompt, you can turn the spotlight on the star of your visual symphony and create a breathtaking masterpiece.

6. Unleash your inner Picasso with Remix mode
Craving a little creative twist to your generated images? Remix mode is like having a magic paintbrush at your fingertips. It lets you dance between variations, blending and bending your prompt, all while using the composition of your starting image as a muse. With Remix mode, the only limit is your imagination!

 

Examples: 

 

A cityscape at night in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night, with swirling skies and glowing streetlights ‚Äìseed 12345
A steampunk submarine exploring a coral reef filled with mechanical sea creatures and sunken treasures ‚Äìseed 67890
A futuristic city skyline with towering skyscrapers, neon lights, and flying cars in a cyberpunk aesthetic ‚Äìseed 13579
A colorful tea party scene in a magical forest, inspired by Alice in Wonderland, with talking animals and oversized teacups ‚Äìseed 24680
 

To activate Remix mode, type "/settings" into the chat and select the 'Remix mode' button. Let your creative juices flow and watch your artwork transform into mesmerizing new versions!

7. Paint your prompts with a splash of color
Looking to infuse your generated images with a kaleidoscope of hues? Adding colours to your prompts in Midjourney is like dipping your brush into a boundless palette of possibilities. Enliven your pictures by specifying the colours you want to see, harmonizing tones, and evoking the mood of your masterpiece. Let your artistic vision take flight as you explore the vibrant world of colour in your AI-generated art!

 

Examples:

 

A lush enchanted forest with emerald-green foliage, magical creatures, and shimmering fairy lights ‚Äìseed 12345
A mesmerizing desert landscape with a blazing red-orange sunset, casting long shadows on the sand dunes ‚Äìseed 67890
A soft, pastel-coloured dreamscape with floating islands, calming waterfalls, and gentle clouds ‚Äìseed 13579
A dynamic, black-and-white graphic novel scene with intense action, dramatic shadows, and captivating characters ‚Äìseed 24680
 

Unleash the full spectrum of your creativity as you blend and balance colors in your Midjourney prompts, bringing your vivid imaginings to life!

8. The art of discovery: Iterate and experiment
Unleashing the full potential of Midjourney is like uncovering a hidden treasure chest of dazzling images. Be bold! Embrace your inner explorer and venture into the unknown, trying out different concoctions of descriptions, styles, keywords, and settings. As you dive deeper into the realm of Midjourney's AI capabilities, you'll unearth the secrets to crafting powerful prompts and awe-inspiring results.
